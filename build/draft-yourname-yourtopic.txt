1.  Introduction

   Remote attestation (RA) enables a Verifier to obtain evidence about
   an Attester's state.  When RA is combined with a secure channel,
   additional properties may be achieved, such as cryptographic binding
   between evidence and a specific channel instance.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "SHOULD", and "MAY" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14.

3.  Use Cases

3.1.  UC-1: Server Attestation to Client

   Text.

4.  Desired Properties

4.1.  P-1: Cryptographic Binding Between Channel and Attestation

   Text.

5.  Security Considerations
